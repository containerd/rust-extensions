[[bin]]
# Overwrite the binary name so it can be referred as "io.containerd.runc.v2-rs" from containerd.
# Note: the runtime's binary name must start with "io.containerd.runc" in order to
# keep compatibility with Go runc runtime and the containerd client.
# Example: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/8047eb2fcac1f4553ee7652862194b1e10855ce7/task_opts_unix.go#L33
