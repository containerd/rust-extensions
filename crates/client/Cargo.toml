#  = Advisory: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0055
#  = `<bytes::Bytes as axum_core::extract::FromRequest>::from_request` would not, by
#    default, set a limit for the size of the request body. That meant if a malicious
#    peer would send a very large (or infinite) body your server might run out of
#    memory and crash.

[features]
connect = ["tokio", "tower"]

# Technically Tonic doesn't require Tokio and Tower dependencies here.
# However we need them to implement `connect` helper and it's highly unlikely
# that Tonic will be used with any other async runtime (see https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/152)
# So we enable `connect` feature by default (use `--no-default-features` otherwise).
