[features]
connect = ["tokio", "tower"]

# Technically Tonic doesn't require Tokio and Tower dependencies here.
# However we need them to implement `connect` helper and it's highly unlikely
# that Tonic will be used with any other async runtime (see https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/152)
# So we enable `connect` feature by default (use `--no-default-features` otherwise).
