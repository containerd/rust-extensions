[features]
# In current implementation we check in all generated TTRPC code because of the following Rust limitations:
# - `include!` doesn't handle well .rs files with attributes: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18810
# - `cargo publish` will complain on modified `src` directory if it's modified from `build.rs` - https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5073
# - There is now way to include the whole module from `OUT_DIR`, not just individual files.
