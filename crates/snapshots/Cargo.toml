# tonic v0.8.1 depends on axum-core v0.2.2, which has security vulnerability:
#  = ID: RUSTSEC-2022-0055
#  = Advisory: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0055
#  = `<bytes::Bytes as axum_core::extract::FromRequest>::from_request` would not, by
#    default, set a limit for the size of the request body. That meant if a malicious
#    peer would send a very large (or infinite) body your server might run out of
#    memory and crash.
#
# This needs to be removed once newer version of tonic is released.
